# openGL
A rendering Engine in OpenGL 4.0

This is a small attempt at learning openGL and graphics rendering in general.
For now I can load basic wavefront models and give associate materials to them.
I managed to get some simple shapes and shaders to render including parralax occlusion mapping and specularity.

I have a basic rendering pipeline that offers the ability to do post processing.

The next step is to build an interface with Qt to be able to edit scenes and materials.

I also want to add realtime shadows, DoF and deferred shading.
